I am a Machine Learning Engineer at PayPal, working on fraud risk detection, compliance, and agentic AI. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at TikTok, where I drove ads measurement through large-scale experimentation and causal inference.

I hold a [Master of Business Analytics](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics#tour-welcome) from MIT and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics & Statistics from Emory University.

I'm interested in building production ML systems and AI-powered products.
