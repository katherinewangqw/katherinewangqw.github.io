I am a Machine Learning Engineer at [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/), working on fraud risk detection, compliance, and agentic AI. Previously, I was a Data Scientist at [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/), where I drove ads measurement through large-scale experimentation and causal inference.

I hold a [Master of Business Analytics](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics#tour-welcome) from MIT Sloan (Operations Research Center) and a B.S. in Applied Mathematics & Statistics from [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html).

I'm interested in building production ML systems and AI-powered products.
