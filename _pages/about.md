<!-- **Currently**{: style="color: #990000; opacity: 0.80;" }, -->
Currently, I am a [Master of Business Analytics](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/master-of-business-analytics#tour-welcome) student at MIT Sloan in conjunction with Operations Research Center.

I obtained my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics & Statistics from [Emory University](https://www.emory.edu/home/index.html), double majored in Economics. I was fortunate to be supervised by Prof. [Seunghwa Rho](https://seunghwarho.github.io/) at the [Department of Quantitative Theory and Methods](https://quantitative.emory.edu/) during my undergraduate studies.

I am passionate in using machine learning techniques to provide insights for decision-making processes, and the [projects](/projects) page has information about my past work and activities.
