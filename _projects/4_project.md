During my junior year at Emory University, I was the president of [Sino-Emory Newsletter](https://sinoemory.wordpress.com/). Through my undergarad, I helped organize and print newsletters on a monthly basis.

Me and our board members also organized monthly member meeting (with food!) and events like Spring Festival at Lunar New Year and acadenmic talks.
